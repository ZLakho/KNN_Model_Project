    "- A retail company wants to predict customer purchasing behavior based on their age, salary and past purchase history. The company aims to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify customers into potential buying groups to personalize marketing strategies. This predictive model will help the company understand and target specific customer segments more effectively, thereby increasing sales and customer satisfaction.\n",
